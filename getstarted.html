        <h4>To get started, follow these easy steps:</h4>

        <ol>

            <li>Contact the people you have selected to work with and determine a mutually acceptable communication platform such as Skype, Adobe Connect, or Google Hangout. Your session may also take place in person. Determine the order in which you will act as the observer, the Health Coach, and/or the client.</li>

            <li>Download the <a href="#">Evaluation Rubric</a> and familiarize yourself with the ICF core coaching competencies.</li>

            <li>Select one of the following client scenarios and give it to the person acting as the client (disregard if you are using an actual client). Conduct the session.

                <h5>Scenario 1</h5>
                <p>This is the client's third session. She signed with the Health Coach to lose weight and increase energy. During their last session, the coach discussed the benefits of incremental changes, and now the client is dealing with hair loss. The client is concerned that she is not getting the right nutrients that her body needs.</p>

                <h5>Scenario 2</h5>
                <p>This is the client's second session. She signed with the Health Coach to reduce her cravings and to learn about new foods and how to incorporate them into her diet. During their last session, the coach discussed the benefits of crowding out, and now the client is overwhelmed with issues that she is having in a personal relationship.</p>

                <h5>Scenario 3</h5>
                <p>This is the client's fifth session. She signed with the Health Coach to feel more confident and energized. The client is dealing with a lot of stress at work, long hours, and she has not maintained healthy habits with food and self-care. During their last session, the Health Coach discovered that the client is having problems sleeping at night. The client has recently gone through a divorce.</p>

            </li>

            <li>If you are the observer, fill out the <a href="#">Evaluation Rubric.</a></li>

            <li>Upon successful completion and submission of an observed coaching session, you will receive a certificate from IIN stating that you received 30 Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH).</li>

            <li>Contact <a href="#">ICF</a> and fulfill their remaining requirements to become a member.</li>

        </ol>
