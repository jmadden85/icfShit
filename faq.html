        <p>30 Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH)<p>

        <p>The International Coach Federation (ICF) is a global organization that supports the growth of coaching professions by providing independent certification. ICF is continually expanding its large network of credentialed coaches while acting as an authoritative source on coaching and research for the public.</p>

        <p>IIN decided to partner with ICF as another means to support its graduates as they build their coaching practices. In addition to being a voice for professional coaching world-wide, ICF maintains a Code of Ethics that adds professionalism to the industry.</p>

        <p>Individuals who have successfully graduated from the Health Coach Training Program, Immersion Program, and who have done one observed coaching session are eligible for 30 hours of Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH) from ICF that may be put toward ICF membership.</p>
