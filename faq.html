        <p>30 Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH)<p>

        <p>The International Coach Federation (ICF) is a global organization that supports the growth of coaching professions by providing independent certification. ICF is continually expanding its large network of credentialed coaches while acting as an authoritative source on coaching and research for the public.</p>

        <p>IIN decided to partner with ICF as another means to support its graduates as they build their coaching practices. In addition to being a voice for professional coaching world-wide, ICF maintains a Code of Ethics that adds professionalism to the industry.</p>

        <p>Individuals who have successfully graduated from the Health Coach Training Program, Immersion Program, and who have done one observed coaching session are eligible for 30 hours of Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH) from ICF that may be put toward ICF membership.</p>

                <h5>What is the International Coach Federation (ICF)?</h5>
                <p>ICF is a nonprofit organization that provides independent certification to Health Coaches and other coaching professionals from around the world.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="two">
                <h5>What type of observed coaching do I need to receive the 30 hours of Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH) from the International Coach Federation (ICF)?</h5>
                <p>Each Immersion graduate needs to complete at minimum one observed, one-hour coaching session and receive an evaluation for the session based on the ICF core coaching competencies. Graduates will group themselves into teams of three: a Health Coach, a client, and an observer. You may choose to work with an actual client if a client agrees to be observed. The observer will submit the coachâ€™s evaluation form on the Student Dashboard. All Immersion graduates will have access to the client scenarios.</p>

                <p>Upon completion and submission of an observed coaching session, the coach will receive a letter from IIN stating that the coach received 30 hours of Approved Coach Specific Training Hours (ACSTH). Evaluations may be submitted through the student dashboard.</p>
            </li>

            <li id="three">
                <h5>What are the client scenarios?</h5>
                <p>We will provide three specific client scenarios for each team to use. Each scenario guides the client to discuss certain issues with the coach. If a fellow Immersion graduate is acting as your client, one of these scenarios must be used in order to qualify for the ACSTH hours.</p>
